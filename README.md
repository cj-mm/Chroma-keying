# Chroma Keying

CMSC 165 Lab Project (Group Project)

> Chroma keying is a technique used for combining two frames or images by replacing a color or a color range in one frame with that from another frame. In this repo, main.py (which needs input files) outputs a video that combines the background of a reference video and the foreground of a video shoot.
